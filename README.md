## What is this

This is a python implementation of **Luby Transform code**, which contains encode & decode procesdures. 
Encoder and Decoder are reconstructed based on [@Anrosent](https://github.com/anrosent/LT-code)'s implementation, many thanks!

~~It will be used in a future project(Haven't decided name yet), which relies on no internet but only camera device to receive data from one device to another.~~

## Progress

- [ ] LT Encoder: Key function and logics are done and tested. 

- [ ] LT Decoder: Still studying the decode process...

- [ ] Protobuf supported. This can be done in a very short time.


To be continued ...
